## ‚ú® Overview

ScreenArc is a powerful, cross-platform screen recording and editing application designed to help you create professional, engaging videos with minimal effort. It's the perfect tool for developers, educators, and content creators who need to produce high-quality tutorials, demos, and presentations.

The core philosophy of ScreenArc is to **automate the tedious parts of video editing**. It intelligently tracks your mouse movements and clicks, automatically creating smooth, cinematic pan-and-zoom effects that keep your audience focused on the action.

## üöÄ Key Features

*   **üé¨ High-Quality Recording:**
    *   Capture your entire screen, a specific application window, or a custom-defined area.
    *   Support for multi-monitor setups.
    *   Simultaneously record your webcam as an overlay.

*   **üñ±Ô∏è Cinematic Mouse Tracking:**
    *   The cornerstone feature: automatically detects mouse clicks and creates smooth pan-and-zoom animations to highlight areas of action. No manual keyframing needed!

*   **‚úÇÔ∏è Powerful & Intuitive Editor:**
    *   **Frame Customization:** Easily change aspect ratios (16:9, 9:16, 1:1), set beautiful backgrounds (colors, gradients, or wallpapers), and adjust padding, borders, and shadows.
    *   **Preset System:** Save your favorite styles as presets and apply them instantly to new projects.
    *   **Timeline Editing:** A visual timeline to add, edit, or remove auto-generated effects. Easily "cut" mistakes or unwanted sections.

*   **üì§ Flexible Export Options:**
    *   Export your final videos in standard formats like **MP4** and **GIF**.
    *   Control output settings like resolution (up to 2K) and frame rate.

## üì¶ Installation

Download the latest version for your operating system from the [**Releases Page**](https://github.com/tamnguyenvan/screenarc/releases/latest).

### üêß Linux (Ubuntu/Debian-based, Fedora/RHEL-based)

> **‚ö†Ô∏è Note:** ScreenArc currently only supports X11 display server and does not work on Wayland. 
> 
> üîç To check your display server, run:
> ```bash
> echo $XDG_SESSION_TYPE
> ```
> 
> ‚ö†Ô∏è If it shows `wayland`, you'll need to switch to X11 in your login screen or display manager settings. (Look for a gear/cog icon ‚öôÔ∏è during login to change the session type)

1.  Download the `.AppImage` file (e.g., `ScreenArc-x.x.x.AppImage`).
2.  Make the file executable:
    ```bash
    chmod +x ScreenArc-*.AppImage
    ```
3.  Double-click the file to start the application or run it from the terminal:
    ```bash
    ./ScreenArc-*.AppImage
    ```
## üí° Tips

- **Prefer the macOS cursor style?** If you'd like to use the macOS cursor theme, you can install it with these commands:
  ```bash
  # 1. Download the macOS cursor theme: https://www.gnome-look.org/p/1408466

  # 2. Extract the theme
  tar -xvf macOS.tar 

  # 3. Move the theme to the icons directory
  mv macOS* ~/.icons/
  ```
  Then apply it through your system settings or using GNOME Tweaks.
